  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    I am a software developer passionate about science, technology, startups, and wrestling.
    During past several years I've been mostly doing web development using Ruby on Rails and related technologies.
    Currently I pursue master's degree at The University of Bonn, Computer Science department. My main focus at
    the university is Intelligent Systems(Machine Learning, Data Mining). I've done several consulting jobs for companies
    from different countries. Currently I work as a Production Engineer at <a href="http://www.shopify.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a>
    - a Canadian based commerce platform that allows anyone to easily sell online, at a retail location, and everywhere in between.
