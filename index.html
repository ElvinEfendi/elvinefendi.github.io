  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    After working for several years as a Backend Developer (primarily using Ruby on Rails),
    I had a career pivot to infrastructure engineering. These days I build and operate large scale,
    distributed infrastructure services. My primary focus has been building control and data plane for North-South and East-West routing infrastructure.

  <p>
    I'm a member of Kubernetes organization and had been an active [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) contributor for few years.
    My main contribution to Kubernetes has been through ingress-nginx where I changed it so that it could [handle Kubernetes endpoints changes dynamically
    without reloading NGINX worker processes](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/2174) among [many other improvements](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AElvinEfendi+is%3Aclosed). Prior to that,
    ingress-nginx was impossible to use in Kubernetes clusters where endpoints change constantly and frequently.
