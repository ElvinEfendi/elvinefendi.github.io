  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    Currently I work as a Production Engineer at <a href="http://www.shopify.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a>
    - a Canadian based commerce platform that allows anyone to easily sell online, at a retail location, and everywhere in between.
    Some of my responsiblities at Shopify are maintaining Load Balancing tier, Lua scripted dynamic request routing using Nginx, protecting the
    platform from Layer 7 (D)DoS attacks and bots, Automated Certificate Management, reducing manual work for traffic engineering and others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before Shopify I worked at a startup called <a href="https://www.fitogram.de" target="_blank">fitogram</a>, a web based fitness and welness directory.
    There I built the MVP from scratch that included internationalized content, Postgresql based full text search, Google Map based UI for search and
    filtering, multi-tenant CMS with subscription for studio owners, appointment scheduling system etc.
    During my time at fitogram I did everything from HTML/CSS coding, dynamic UIs using Javascript/JQuery to full Rails stack,
    deployment and database administration.
  </p>
  <p>
    While at fitogram I was also pursuing my master's degree at University of Bonn, Computer Science department. My main focus there has been
    Intelligent Systems(Machine Learning, Data Mining).
